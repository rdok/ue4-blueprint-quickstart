# UE4 Blueprint Quickstart
> This quick start guide will walk you through building an Actor in the level with different Components, then turning it into a Blueprint Class you can add launching behavior to so your Character will fly around the level! Making it into a Blueprint Class also means you can create as many launchpads in your world as you want, just by dragging into the level from the Content Browser.
